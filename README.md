Real-Time Chat Application using Socket.IO
This project is a simple real-time chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. It allows users to join a chat room, send messages, and view messages from others in real-time. The app also displays the total number of active clients and shows typing feedback when a user is composing a message. The front-end interacts with the server through Socket.IO to handle message communication and feedback.

Features
Real-time Communication: Messages sent by any user are instantly broadcasted to all connected clients.
Client Count: Displays the total number of clients connected to the server.
Typing Indicator: Notifies users when someone is typing a message.
Audio Notification: Plays a sound whenever a new message is received.
Responsive Front-End: Automatically scrolls to the latest message and updates the UI dynamically.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
Express: Web framework for handling routes and serving static files.
Socket.IO: Enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and the server.
Moment.js: For formatting timestamps in a human-readable way.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Front-end components for user interaction.
